Bugs

1 - bug when starting over, not keeping state of radio so not updating. need to alter this to useState
2 - ideally the button for show answers would not show if the result was not a returned series of questions
3 - styling to remove the space at the top of the login details
4 - doesn't seem to be providing detail for some topics

e.g. rivers not coming up for geography, drama not returning hardly anything

Other: 

- add in ability to track progress against DB headings
